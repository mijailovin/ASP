Homework on course Algorithms and Data Structure.
First tasks is to implement graph using adjacency arrays, and other basic functionalities such as:
1. Node adding
2. Edge adding
3. Writing of a whole graph
4. Edge deleting
5. Node deleting
6. Deleting of a whole graph

Second task is to implement Kruskal's algortihm and Dijkstra algorithm. Implementation of a graph from first task with edge weight addition is used.

Exceptions handling is used.
